# Project1-NapsterVents

## Combining two great innovations into one
This application allows users to search different music artists in the industry and add them to a personal favorite profile. By inputing a zip code, you can also search artist information in conjunction with events for this artist in your particular area. Find an event you like? Add it to your favorites. All artist and event favorites are saved conveniently on the left navigation bar. No longer interested in an event? Delete it from your favorites. 

Project is pulling from Napster API, Ticketmaster API and Google API.
